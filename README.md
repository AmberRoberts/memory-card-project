## Instructions

Test your skill with this memory matching gameâ€”click to flip a card, and try to find its pair. If the cards do not match, they'll flip back over.  If they do, they will stay face-up and you get to try for another match.  When you have matched all 16 cards (8 pairs), you win! But don't use too many moves or you'll lose stars in your score. Check your final score in the pop up at the end.

Can you beat my personal best score of 12 moves in 28 seconds?
